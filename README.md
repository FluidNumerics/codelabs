## Research Computing Cloud

The RCC is a highly flexible auto-scaling Slurm based cluster on Google Cloud that comes with a suite of software build stacks (compilers & MPI flavors), profiling tools for HPC applications, and the Singularity container platform. The RCC is offered with a Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, or Rocky Linux OS at the base, and can easily be extended to incorporate user applications through traditional centralized package management, [image baking processes](https://github.com/fluidnumerics/rcc-apps), or containerization.

* [Run the WRF Weather Forecasting Model with the RCC](https://fluidnumerics.github.io/rcc-codelabs/rcc/wrf-on-rcc)
* [Get Started with Continuous Benchmarking using RCC-Run](https://fluidnumerics.github.io/rcc-codelabs/rcc-run/continuous-benchmarking-intro)
* (Coming Soon) Create a Research Computing Cluster on Google Cloud

## Fluid-Slurm-GCP
*Please note that Fluid-Slurm-GCP will be deprecated on May 31, 2022. We recommend migrating to the RCC Solutions*

## Cloud-CFD

 The [Cloud-CFD Solution](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/fluid-cluster-ops/cloud-cfd) is a click-to-deploy solution on Google Cloud Marketplace that is part of Fluid Numerics' RCC Suite of solutions. Cloud-CFD provides pre-installed open-source tools and pre-configured compute partitions for running [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/), [Paraview](https://paraview.org), and [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/).

* [Run OpenFOAM on Google Cloud with Cloud-CFD](https://fluidnumerics.github.io/rcc-codelabs/cloud-cfd/run-openfoam-on-gcp-with-cloud-cfd)
* [Connect your Paraview Client with Paraview Server on Cloud-CFD](https://fluidnumerics.github.io/rcc-codelabs/cloud-cfd/connect-your-paraview-client-with-paraview-server)
